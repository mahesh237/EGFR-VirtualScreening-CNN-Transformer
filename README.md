# A Hybrid Deep Learning Framework Integrating CNNs and Transformers for Virtual Screening of EGFR Inhibitors

This project implements a hybrid deep learning framework that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers to perform virtual screening of potential inhibitors targeting the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR).

## Features
- CNN-based feature extraction from molecular descriptors and fingerprints
- Transformer-based sequence modeling of molecular data
- Integration of both architectures for improved predictive performance
- Application to drug discovery and EGFR inhibition

## Repository Structure
- `src/`: Source code for the CNN, Transformer, and hybrid framework
- `data/`: Placeholder for datasets or links
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for experiments
- `results/`: Output metrics and plots
- `declarations/`: Documents required for journal submission

## Requirements
Install the required packages with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
